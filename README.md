# Cover Letter

Hello Professor,

My reference document covers the material of the 2020 fast.ai course. I believe it is a worthwhile effort because of three reasons:

1. It fulfills a purpose. Fast.ai material is extensive, and there exists no quick way to skim over the contents. Either one watches the lectures in full, or one is left with the alternative of just reading the section titles. No quick summary exists.
2. The audience is large. The bigger the audience, the more potential positive impact. A lot of people read the fast.ai material and take the course. 
3. It covers content highly relevant to my career. Machine Learning is a very rapidly growing field that I am interested in, and by spending time with the material I believe I can not only improve my technical communication and my ability to extract and concisely transmit key information, but also learn that information myself.

Regards,

Hugo

## Audience and Purpose

There are two distinct audiences that this technical reference aims to serve.

#### First time learners

The fast.ai course is, essentially, a deep dive into Machine Learning. It covers a lot of content in an accessible \(but somewhat exhaustive\) manner. Course-takers are mostly composed of people with some software engineering experience, but little Machine Learning exposure. This document then serves as a high level overview of the extensive material, as well as a quick reference and summary of specific topics.

#### Past course-takers and temporary visitors

As stated, the amount of material that fast.ai covers is quite large. Additionally, they oftentimes review and include new papers and newly released state of the art techniques, and thus the material itself changes quite often.

A person that has taken the course in the past may have some immediate need to access some part of the material. For example, a software developer at a small startup trying to implement a recommendation system. They may however not have enough time or be willing to wade through all the material again to find the relevant information. This document would then save them a significant amount of time by presenting the material in an easily digestible manner.
