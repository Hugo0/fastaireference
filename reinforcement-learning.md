# Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is used whenever there is an agent that acts in a dynamic environment. Some examples:

* Chess AI \(or any videogame AI\)
* Self-driving cars \(after processing video with [CV](computer-vision/)\)
* Robotics

Reinforcement learning works by letting the agent make decisions, and _punish_ or _reward_ it according to its results.

Since this learning is mostly unsupervised, it can lead to surprising outcomes.
