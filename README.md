# Cover Letter

Hello Professor,

This

## Audience and Purpose

There are two distinct audiences that this technical reference aims to serve.

#### First time learners

The fast.ai course is, essentially, a deep dive into Machine Learning. It covers a lot of content in an accessible \(but somewhat exhaustive\) manner. Course-takers are mostly composed of people with some software engineering experience, but little Machine Learning exposure. This document then serves as a high level overview of the extensive material, as well as a quick reference and summary of specific topics.

#### Past course-takers and temporary visitors

As stated, the amount of material that fast.ai covers is quite large. Additionally, they oftentimes review and include new papers and newly released state of the art techniques, and thus the material itself changes quite often.

A person that has taken the course in the past may have some immediate need to access some part of the material. For example, a software developer at a small startup trying to implement a recommendation system. They may however not have enough time or be willing to wade through all the material again to find the relevant information. This document would then save them a significant amount of time by presenting the material in an easily digestible manner.

## Distribution

The content is hosted online at [www.fastaireference.com](www.fastaireference.com). Users can:

* Search
* Navigate the contents menu
* Export the entire reference document as PDF \(for printing or offline access\)
